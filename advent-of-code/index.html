    </header><p>I&rsquo;ve heard about advent of code previous years but have never taken part. This year I decided to try and join in on as many challenges as my schedule allowed. I can prance with 12 points and 6 challenges fulfilled as of 15 days in to December.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I think this will be it for me. The challenges are fun, but I&rsquo;m missing some sort of performance evaluation. Right now it is all about just finishing the challenges as quickly as possible when released, and no focus on who does the most elegant or effective solution. On the other hand, maybe that is the charm, just focusing on solving the problems with no performance anxiety.</p>
<p>In the upcoming days I will compile some blog posts on what I have learned.</p>
<p>The posts compiled after this post:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/reading-input-cpp">Reading file input in c++</a></li>
<li><a href="/parsing-with-regex">Parsing text with regex in c++</a></li>
<li><a href="/sort-anything-with-stdsort-and-comparator">Sort anything with std::sort and a comparator</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All of my six solutions are present on <a href="https://github.com/hilmers/advent_of_code_2020">github</a></p>
